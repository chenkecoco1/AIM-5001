    "4. (7 Points) Suppose you have ridden a bicycle from New York City to Key West, Florida. Your bicycle odometer shows the total miles you have travelled thus far, which you make a note of each day with paper and pencil. Your first two entries might be ‘55’ and ‘120’, indicating that you rode your bike 55 miles on day 1 and 65 miles on day 2. Your task is to create a NumPy array wherein you can record the cumulative miles you recorded each day during your trip “by hand”. Then use your Python skills to show the total miles that you rode each day. Assume the trip took a total of 35 days and included at least 4 non-consecutive days where no cycling was possible due to either weather conditions or personal fatigue/soreness. For the remaining 31 days, you would have covered the entire distance between NYC and Key West. Complete your work within your Jupyter Notebook for this assignment and be sure to include a writeup explaining your approach to this problem, including the ways in which you decided to make use of NumPy."

Using numpy array cane be easier to do the substraction if the values are at the correspondent position, which means if the array can apply substraction on values having the same index. It can be implement by 2 ways. The first is doing misplaced substraction. The second will be using following value substracting previous value."
